Meditations
“No providence”
Good and evil all from perspective of actor and not the things received (power of good or evil, not same substance as actor’s will due to clear historical contradictory reactions). Goodness as intention rather than detached context. See the realtive evil as evil out of plabning (desire, first omvement, agency) rsyher than evil out of anger (unconscious rrsction to pain)
Pleasure is “dead”, immediately forgotten and leaves no mark on anything (including actor), “quickly perished and forgotten”, contrast with heroism and good, pleasure leads to a negative remembrance of oneself, and this “long term story” is what is important (story as long term information transmission to overcome forgetting)
To come near to deity is to transcend operation of nature (unconscious pleasure seeking and following vs free will), divine as power above nature; to overcome natural evolutionary state of mvmt toward pleasure, and stick to rationality, is to find this, and tap into infinite power (sticking to princip in face of any mvmt of world, and thus always overcoming and surmounting them; power defined by function over “base virtues” and other (in this case, “the external”))
Pleasure intrinsically meaningless and externally powerless; can resist and NOTHING bad will happen (no net negative), but resisting as an action is something powerful and meaningful. However, literal opposite is true in other case. Pleasure tempts is defined when it contradicts rationality and the good. Its “benefit” then, if contradictory to reason and virtue, is meaningless, empty, illusory, mere freedom from unpleasantness and a mirage of pleasantness; the mirage of pleasantness is what produces the pain and conflict; but remaining the same state (before temptation of pleasure which threatens to change and derail the state) was not unpleasant in itself, and there was nothing bad about it; like the snake in the garden of eden, ecerything was great before the snake showed the apple, and the apple was never necessary, not sven from an emotional persp. Remember GOD said NOT to est, so they knew what was wrong; and usually so do we. Perhaps indicative of determinism of univ, delressingly, thay we still fall in to these things despite onowledge of yheir evil; but there is a way, and it is to alogn with Goodness, on the core level (as the atomic value, be6ond hypocrisy)
Realm of thought and realm of action, need go bridge, useless theorizing (books and petry) and misaligned action. Like paychopath (misaligned but optimal in domain, but cant think or look outsode) and thoughtlessness (toget), or negative thought spiral (depression, incrl, delusion) and not scting (or acting foffeenetly; agency) as reality xheck. Too much yin is not enougj yang, and vice versa
“Prying into things beneath esrtg” — too much thought, not enougj actiom, leads to evil (seeking into mind of others by conjectrur). Perhaos proposes that some things should not be considered because they are unknowablel and so subject to mosint that is scaffolding for evil. “Beneath esrth” referring to intrinsic lack of grounding. But be careful, do we know where the estth lies? Would be more appropriate to say that some things should nit be conjectured upon based on “value” of the outcome of the conjecture, does it strsy or lead to strays from the way, in its pbjdctive or by its conclusion, based on things that cannot be oroved? Otherwsie, i see innovation as a virtue, geniuses “probe the groubd level” and adjust accordingy, whuch is onky s good thing.
“Keep pure frpm lassion” careful. Wb passion for good? Passion denoting eneegy (link to yinyang exploit, physics)
Faith in goodness or snything necessaitates “passion” beyond reason; the fact that we don’t know anything and cannot prove anything and the existence of alternate (even if improbable) angles, that can be more immeidately satisting to subscribe to at any ooint in time, is used against us in twmptation; alignment to good, passion, nexessitate a love beyond reason
goodness as abs inertia; cannot be deviated from, external force not really a force from this persoextivd . Physics, concept of frame, moving object thst only needs to stay wothin some orbit, hit by other objects; cannot go with inf veloct6 (otherwise leaves orbit), but can apply unbounded force against those other objects wothor pursuing that directikn long run; clesrly involves discontinuity in physics (betobd bature), orbit as never going too far in ying or yang; infinite rile subset (circle os infonite, can feel oneself at its borders, general “rule” can be taken to extreme and out of the cofcle ), infonite force potential emanaring from thong the object prbots sroind (goodness), but actor clearly cam be seayed by things, so another discont, actor “chooses” to look at and harmess object, otherwise subject to natural laws of physics; mo external force is infinitely powerdul, always fin; but goodness overdomes any finite number (thus infinite), neger temoted beyond capability; discontinuities as “above nature”, divine
Some moght sau opposingly that these discont’s disprove the concept of goodness; but relies on assumpt that physicsl world is all there is, which is a faith based statement in itself; loke saying we are in the realm of rational numbers and not complex nimbers, in opersfing with 2 ratiknal numbers we only get another rational, and over our whole life we never perceive the complex number, though it is the overarching number system.

Faith

Problem of unknown, we could be wrong; but all that matters is faith and love and not rules, so we are ok



Nice quotes i came up with
Reason is governed by, and used to serve, some deep fantasy



AI - safe but unlokely, vs more realistic but ridky if wrong

1 —— Components of an art (li) are never bad in themselves; however they sum to an art, whose value we can judge. Countable nonadditivity. Art integrates components that are not within the base comlonents


Li, people love it, in art and in reality and their own sibjwction, link to archetypes and overarching morality

Theories, faith, probabilities of valid systems, acting according to exodcted value, oversll orbsbiloty of a system



Manipulation and good; love pf social ststus; people hate actual good people; those they lovingly perceive as good (in current time and place) are usually evil and manipulators

Alexandrr - charisma, divine, virtur (true and shown), clemency and good actions with his power, decisive brutal beginning to reign
People put up with things based on past strong demos of virtue
