    <h1>中文 (Chinese language/culture) - 事实胜于雄辩</h1>
    <br/><br/>
    It has been way too long since I've written any articles. I now intend to write far more frequently than before, for various reasons...
    <br/><br/>
    I intend this website and collection of articles to be a resource for learning, a sharing of my ideas, so that it may help others. It is also a catalog of my own thoughts, so that my own ideas may be timestamped. Of course, this website lags way behind the ever-accelerating mountain of my actual ideas.
    <br/><br/>
    I have been learning the Chinese language for quite a while now, however, my learning has been extremely sparse and I tend to forget what I have learned. (Side note: I am far too chaotic, I need harness my chaos to create discipline). I shall write articles detailing some of my progress, especially when the concepts arising from the sentences and the words have a lot of meaning. At some point I will perhaps write the entire article in Chinese.
    <br/><br/>
    This article is about the saying 事实胜于雄辩 - which, roughly translated means
    
    <!-- Article roadmap
    - Chinese charcters, their composite build-up from roots and radicals (note the deep meaning behjind a root and a radical - a radical is very abstract on its own, it is an operator) and their meaning
    - the meanings of the characters here - recall especially 雄 (forearm, short tailed bird) and 辩 (toilsome speech toilsome - usual destr)
    - Whether it is true, when it is true

    <h2>The Chinese language - a very incomplete conceptual observation</h2>
    The Chinese language is a beautiful language. I say this because of its mathematical properties. 
    <br/><br/>
    Forwarning: this section will be quite mathematical. 
    <br/><br/>
    I believe the grammar of languages tends to converge to a patternistic graph, with similar (though not the same for all languages) degrees of freedom. By degrees of freedom I mean axioms, roots, operators, base concepts. Examples of this include tense, masculine/feminine, noun versus action (interestingly enough, verbs have a noun asociated with them. For verb <i>v</i> there is a noun which is "the performing of <i>v</i>". This has many implications.) Some list of base concepts and ways to transform them. (Note for later: explain why there are similar base axioms for most languages. It relates to humanity and the way they see the world, what they would communicate about. And why there are differences - this relates to the differences of cultural environment or state when they started consolidating the language).
    <br/><br/>
    A lot of language is "generated smoothly" by these axioms. For example: consider the action of walking. In the past: I walked. In the present: I am walking. In the future: I am going to walk. These base transformations of abstract object and action can generate very many words and sentences on their own. (Note for later: I should talk in a future article about when a language can generate infinite amounts of different words and sentences, versus when the language is bounded and neds to add more degrees of freedom to be infinitely generating. Also there are many types of "inifinite generation". Consider regular expressions and (sentence)* which is mere repetition, versus many words in the language (<i>w_i</i>) and random positions of them, which satisfy some structure. This can be modelled as constrained generation. We can go even further by generating new words and constantly extending the field according to certain rules) 
    <br/><br/>
    Of course, every language also has exceptions to the rule. Humans often come into contact with things which cannot be described easily with the current set of words or grammar. This hapens when humans come into contact with unknown beings or experiences. Or humans are merely too lazy to use the proper grammar and little by litle the grammar adapts in an evolutionary fashion according to the populace and the ways of life they settle upon. Or the populace becomes divided into different groups, who distinguish themselves by different ways of speaking - trendsetters (for better or for worse). Often such trendsetters change the course of the grammar, often complicating matters and coming into friction with the "old ways" (though sometimes such amendment can be good. Yes I can be a very literal person. Though, don't worry ladies, I am also a man of subtlety here and there...)
    <br/><br/>
    I have an idea of an interesting language metric to understand the "compression" and generative proportion of a language. How many degrees of freedom are there, and how do the words/composite objects of the language get gerneated by them? For example, if there is (df1) amd (df2), how many objects of the language get generated, versus those that COULD get generated by them? If df1 and df2 could create <i>n</i> items in the language but they only create <i>m</i> items (<i>m &lt n</i>), or if there is a way to create an item with those degrees of freedom but they are instead created by another set of degrees of freedom, and whether this set is larger or less than the first. This could create an interesting analysis of the language. One could also simulate or mathematically show how generating language from ground up axioms (roots, radicals, grammar in Chinese) differs from the commonly accepted phrases in the language.
    <br/><br/>
    Chinese is a language which is beautifully linked and generative from base concepts. There are roots and radicals (TODO continue later. A radical is too abstract to be defined easily, and acts as an operator. A root has a clear meaning and can be combined with other roots or radicals. A word is a composite. Can link language to linear independence, perhaps even prime numbers). 
    <br/><br/>


    <h2>The meaning of each word in 事实胜于雄辩, and explanations in terms of composition</h2>
    I will write the meaning of each word individually and 
    <ul>
        <li>事 - shì - matter/thing. Denotes an abstaction of use cases of an object</li>
        <li>实 - shí - real/sincere. Note that this is the combination of the radicall for lid and 头 - tóu - which means head/top. This denotes a link between the head and the outside world, one in which the head is open to the reality above, with different degrees of closure.</li>
