    <h1>中文 (Chinese language/culture) - 事实胜于雄辩</h1>
    <br/><br/>
    It has been way too long since I've written any articles. I now intend to write far more frequently than before, for various reasons...
    <br/><br/>
    I intend this website and collection of articles to be a resource for learning, a sharing of my ideas, so that it may help others. It is also a catalog of my own thoughts, so that my own ideas may be timestamped. Of course, this website lags way behind the ever-accelerating mountain of my actual ideas.
    <br/><br/>
    I have been learning the Chinese language for quite a while now, however, my learning has been extremely sparse and I tend to forget what I have learned. (Side note: I am far too chaotic, I need harness my chaos to create discipline). I shall write articles detailing some of my progress, especially when the concepts arising from the sentences and the words have a lot of meaning. At some point I will perhaps write the entire article in Chinese.
    <br/><br/>
    This article is about the saying 事实胜于雄辩 - which, roughly translated means
    
    <!-- Article roadmap
    - Chinese charcters, their composite build-up from roots and radicals (note the deep meaning behjind a root and a radical - a radical is very abstract on its own, it is an operator) and their meaning
    - the meanings of the characters here - recall especially 雄 (forearm, short tailed bird) and 辩 (toilsome speech toilsome - usual destr)
    - Whether it is true, when it is true

    <h2>The Chinese language - a very incomplete conceptual observation</h2>
    The Chinese language is a beautiful language. I say this because of its mathematical properties. 
    <br/><br/>
    I believe the grammar of languages tends to converge to a patternistic graph, with similar (though not the same for all languages) degrees of freedom. 

    - can be moothly generated ground up, can be understood top down, in a manner that closely converges.
