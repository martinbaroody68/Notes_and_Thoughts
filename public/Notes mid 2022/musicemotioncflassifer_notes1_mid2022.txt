Music emotion classifier?
Probabilistic classification approach that adapts from initial priors somehow
Perhaps it can even create new clusters!
Or even predict descriptors and genres!!! (Use RYM descriptors and genres!)
Perhaps some online method of adding new genres, clustering genres, etc
Use learned encodings for each genre, pretrained embeddings for descriptors which we then fine tune
Cluster music together as well (nice for recommendations), perhaps even cluster based on some vague metric (mood, style etc)
Use word2vec or something similar as initial word embeddings
